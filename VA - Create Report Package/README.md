# VA - Create Report Package

## Description
Exports a package for the report in a compressed (zip) format. The returned content contains the report source files, plus the results of data queries and image rendering, constituting all that is needed for remote viewing of the report.

The step needs the location and name of the report and a physical location where the package will be stored.

The name of the package will always be the same as the report name with the optional addition of a date, format YYYYMMDD, or timestamp, format YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.

## SAS Viya version support

This custom step is created and tested in Viya 4, Stable 2025.08
