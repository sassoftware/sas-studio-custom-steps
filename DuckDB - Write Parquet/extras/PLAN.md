# PLAN

Sometimes the case is that folks just want to move data towards parquet.

In association with colleagues such as Jeff S (details later), we look to expose some of our approaches and advice through custom step, which (some might agree, and with the exception of some others) are a little more consummable compared to raw programs and macros.

Incremental, small steps towards progress.

1. Close on the heels of [DuckDB - Extract Parquet Metadata](../../DuckDB%20-%20Extract%20Parquet%20Metadata/README.md) why don't we take up the basic case of rewriting existing parquet to parquet?
2. Don't bite the hand that feeds.  Let us take a SAS dataset and write to parquet. Simple. Move the entire thing lock, stock and barrel.

(Of course, as those peeking at this will be so eager to point out, we need our reasons in place.  We need our use case in place.  Sometimes it could be just whimsy. Agree :))
