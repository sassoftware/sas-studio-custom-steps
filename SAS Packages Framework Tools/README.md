# SAS Packages Framework Tools

## Description
The [SAS Packages Framework](https://github.com/yabwon/SAS_PACKAGES), created by [Bart Jablonski](https://github.com/yabwon), allows users to develop and use SAS packages:

> A SAS package is an automatically generated, single, stand alone zip file containing organised and ordered code structures, created by the developer and extended > with additional automatically generated "driving" files (i.e. description, metadata, load, unload, and help files).
>
> The purpose of a package is to be a simple, and easy to access, code sharing medium, which will allow: on the one hand, to separate the code complex dependencies > created by the developer from the user experience with the final product and, on the other hand, reduce developer's and user's unnecessary frustration related to > a remote deployment process.

These custom steps add an interface around the SAS Packages Framework, enabling SAS Packages to be easily embedded into a SAS Studio code flow.

## Features
- Initialize, install, load, and update SAS packages in one step using the latest version, your own URL, or a local `SPFInit.sas` file
- Choose from the rich ecocsystem of SAS packages: [SASPAC](https://github.com/SASPAC), [PharmaForest](https://github.com/PharmaForest/), GitHub, or your own  custom repository
- Install, load, and unload SAS packages as individual steps for granular control
- Load SAS packages individually with advanced options, or load many packages in bulk
- Unload packages individually or in bulk
